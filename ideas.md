**Design Movement**: Y2K Digital Nostalgia

**Core Principles**:
- Embrace early 2000s digital camera aesthetics with authentic retro elements
- Celebrate playful imperfection through scattered stickers and casual layouts
- Prioritize tactile, fun interactions that mimic physical photo booth experiences
- Create emotional warmth through nostalgic visual language

**Color Philosophy**: 
High-contrast film photography palette with bright whites, deep blacks, and pops of neon accent colors (electric blue, hot pink, lime green). The emotional intent is to evoke the excitement and spontaneity of disposable camera parties and early digital photography.

**Layout Paradigm**: 
Mobile-first vertical flow with full-screen camera view and floating UI elements. Sticker overlays positioned asymmetrically to mimic physical photo decorations. Film strip output uses authentic 35mm proportions with sprocket holes and date stamps.

**Signature Elements**:
- Authentic film grain and light leak effects
- Hand-drawn style sticker graphics with white borders
- Retro LCD-style date/time stamps
- Polaroid-inspired instant preview animations

**Interaction Philosophy**: 
Interactions should feel immediate and satisfying—camera shutter with haptic feedback, stickers that "stick" with bounce animations, and instant gratification through quick processing. Every tap should reinforce the playful, nostalgic experience.

**Animation**:
- Camera capture: Flash effect with slight shake
- Sticker placement: Bounce and rotate on drop
- Film strip generation: Slide-in from bottom with photo developing effect
- Download: Polaroid-style shake animation

**Typography System**:
- Display: "Permanent Marker" for playful headers and sticker text
- UI Elements: "Space Mono" for retro digital camera LCD aesthetic
- Body: "DM Sans" for clean, readable interface text
Hierarchy: Bold display for event titles, monospace for technical info (dates, camera settings), sans-serif for instructions.

**Design Movement**: Brutalist Digital Utility

**Core Principles**:
- Raw, unpolished interface that prioritizes function over decoration
- Honest presentation of technical processes and camera mechanics
- Bold typography and stark contrast as primary visual elements
- Embrace digital artifacts and glitches as aesthetic features

**Color Philosophy**:
Monochromatic base (pure black, white, grays) with single accent color (safety orange or industrial yellow) for interactive elements. The intent is to create a tool-like, no-nonsense interface that feels professional and efficient while maintaining visual interest through stark contrast.

**Layout Paradigm**:
Grid-based modular system with hard edges and no rounded corners. Camera viewfinder occupies exact 4:3 ratio. UI controls arranged in geometric blocks. Film strip output uses mathematical precision with visible grid lines and measurement markers.

**Signature Elements**:
- Exposed technical metadata (resolution, timestamp, file size)
- Geometric sticker shapes (circles, squares, triangles) with hard edges
- Monospace typography for all text elements
- Visible grid overlays and alignment guides

**Interaction Philosophy**:
Interactions should be direct and unambiguous—no easing curves, only linear transitions. Buttons provide clear feedback through color inversion. The interface communicates exactly what it's doing at all times through status indicators and progress bars.

**Animation**:
- Camera capture: Instant cut to black, no fade
- Sticker placement: Snap to grid with no bounce
- Film strip generation: Linear wipe from top to bottom
- Download: Progress bar with percentage indicator

**Typography System**:
- All text: "JetBrains Mono" or "IBM Plex Mono" for unified monospace aesthetic
- Weight variations (Light for body, Bold for headers) create hierarchy
- Letter-spacing increased for display text to enhance geometric feel

**Design Movement**: Neo-Memphis Maximalism

**Core Principles**:
- Explosive energy through clashing patterns and bold geometric shapes
- Celebration of excess—more is more in color, pattern, and decoration
- Playful chaos that encourages creative expression
- Retro-futuristic blend of 80s Memphis design with modern digital aesthetics

**Color Philosophy**:
Saturated, clashing color combinations (hot pink + electric yellow, cyan + orange, lime + purple) layered with geometric patterns. Emotional intent is pure joy and creative freedom—colors should energize and excite, making photo-taking feel like a party.

**Layout Paradigm**:
Asymmetric composition with overlapping elements and diagonal orientations. Camera interface framed by decorative geometric borders. Stickers float in organized chaos. Film strip output breaks traditional boundaries with rotated frames and pattern-filled backgrounds.

**Signature Elements**:
- Squiggly lines, zigzags, and abstract shapes as decorative elements
- Duotone halftone patterns and gradient meshes
- Oversized geometric stickers with neon outlines
- Layered shadows and offset borders for depth

**Interaction Philosophy**:
Interactions should be exuberant and surprising—buttons that squish and stretch, stickers that wobble, colors that shift on hover. Every interaction adds to the sense of playful chaos and creative energy.

**Animation**:
- Camera capture: Explosive burst of confetti and geometric shapes
- Sticker placement: Elastic bounce with rotation and scale overshoot
- Film strip generation: Pieces slide in from random directions, assembling like a puzzle
- Download: Celebratory animation with spinning shapes and color flashes

**Typography System**:
- Display: "Righteous" or "Fredoka One" for bold, rounded headers
- Accent: "Bebas Neue" for condensed impact text
- Body: "Outfit" for clean, geometric readability
Hierarchy: Mix ultra-bold display with condensed accents, creating dynamic contrast through scale and weight.
